# Arithmetic Test

The main aim of my project is a very simple and concise one; to create a site where you can go and test your basic arithmetic skills. I gained inspiration for this project,
because when I was young me and my siblings would to randomly test each other on the spot, from addition to multiplication.
The website's target market is anyone interested in arithmetics, from young children to adults who enjoy quick maths games.

## UX
 I aim to do this by creating a website which is both easy to navigate and user friendly. The site will have a minimalistic feel, by that I mean, the site will focus on the game and not an overload of text. I aim to provide just the key information needed for potential users. 
The site will feature different games, both a simple addition game and a slightly harder multiplication game.

### Colour and Typography
In regards to the design, I opted for a simple colour scheme. The main colours are a darker shade of blue, orange, grey and some black and white. Additionally on the hover effect there is a shade of orange for the navigation bar.
For the typography, I opted to use Noto Serif and Architects Daughter for the actual game.

### User Stories

#### User
- As a user I want to be able to navigate the page easily. 
- Additionally, I want to be able to easily play the game and know if my answer was correct. Whenever I get an answer incorrect, I want to know what the right answer was. 
- Lastly, I would like to be able to see the current leader board plus the social media pages for me to interact and follow.

#### Website owner
- As the website owner, I want to add a navigation form, so that users can click on each, and it will easily navigate them to that section of the page.
- By adding a check button, users can check if their answer was correct, this will make it better because they will know the answer before going on to the next maths question.
- As the website owner, I want our social media links to be clear at the bottom of the page, this will lead to more activity on our pages. 

## Features
On my website, there are a total of 5 features. Below I will discuss each briefly, and state it's purpose. 

### Existing Features
1. Navigation bar: This allows user to easily navigate the page and get to whichever section they want. To do this, they simplify
   click on the relevant section on the navigation bar.
1. Addition game: This game is a simple addition game, the page will randomly generate two numbers and all you have to do is submit and press check.
1. Multiplication game: Similar to the addition game this is also a simple multiplication game, the page will randomly generate two numbers and all you have to do is submit and press check.
1. Leaderboard: Allows users to see who are the current top scorers on the game and where they are from.
1. Footer: This contains our social media links in the form of icons. Which allows users to check out our social media pages, and contact us.

### Future Features
In future I would make a few additions. 

- I would have a timer, and a user can see how many right answers they can get in a limited time.
- I would also add a way to submit the score so users can go into the leader board if they get a top score.
- Lastly, I would want a feature to make the sums and addition questions either easy or difficult, to accommodate different levels.

## Technologies Used
Here is a list of all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that I have used to construct my project. 

1. [GitHub](https://github.com/): 
Used to create the repository and where you push your code to. Used for deployment and version control.

1. [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/): 
Used to write the code and style and where you push your code to Github.

1. HTML and CSS: For these two I could not find the official websites, which is why I have not provided a link. I used HTML for the structure of the page and CSS to style the page.

1. [Bootstrap Javascript](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/): 
The project uses Bootstrap JS scripts to be able to use the dropdown menu on the navigation bar. The drop down menu is active on the smaller screens.

1. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/):
I used Bootstrap to code most of the website. Firsty, to structure the layout of the page, by using the container, rows and columns feature.

1. [Cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/):
Cdnjs provided the library for the hover over effects on the navigation bar.

1. [FreeFormatter](https://www.freeformatter.com/):
This technically did not help me create the project, however I used this website to format both my HTML and CSS code. This will make it easier for anyone reading my code in the future.

1. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/):
Google Fonts provided the font for my website. 

1. [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview#all): 
Google maps was used to add a map with markers for the topscorers on the table.

1. [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/): 
Used to create my initial wireframes at the start of the project.


## Deployment
To deploy my project, I took the following steps.

### Deploying via Github (Available to repository owner only)

1. To publish the project go on to the **Github Pages**.
1. The go on to the **repository** in Github and select the **settings** tab.
1. From there if you scroll down to the Github Pages section and in the source dropdown, select **none** for source and then select **"master branch"**.
1. The page then reloaded. When you then scroll down to the GitHub Pages section again, you'll see a message that states that was **site is ready to be published**, with a link.
1. If you open this link, it will take you to your site. 
1. Should take no longer than a minute on average.
1. However, if after 10 minutes, the link doesn't work, try to repeat the process again (selecting **none** for source, then selecting **master branch**).

### Running Locally (Available to anyone)

1. Go to the **GitHub pages**.
1. Go to the relevant **repository**.
1. Select the '**Clone or Download**' dropdown.
1. Then **Download Zip**.
1. Once downloaded, if you click on it, you will be taken to the **downloaded folder**.
1. When you open the folder, you will need to open the **index.html**.
1. Now you should see the project site on your desktop.

### Acknowledgements

I received inspiration and code for this project from looking at the website which I have listed below:

- [JS Math addition App](https://jsbeginners.com/javascript-math-addition-app/):
I initially saw this game and it gave me the motivation to create this project. I have used the code and amended it to suit my project. 
Additionally, I have left a comment on top of the code which I used and amended.

Plus, I ofcourse used code from previous projects on Code Institute, but as mentioned, I have commented where specific code has been used.

Lastly, I have recieved great support from my mentor Rohit, especially with my Javascript code, plus the Tutor team at Code Institute and fellow coders on Slack.
