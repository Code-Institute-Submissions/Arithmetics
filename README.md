# Arithmetic Test

The main aim of my project is a very simple and concise one; to create a site where you can go and test your basic arithmetic skills. I gained inspiration for this project,
because when I was young me and my siblings would to randomly test each other on the spot, from addition to multiplication.
The website's target market is anyone interested in arithmetics, from young children to adults who enjoy quick maths games.

## UX
 I aim to do this by creating a website which is both easy to navigate and user friendly. The site will have a minimalistic feel, by that I mean, the site will focus on the game and not an overload of text. I aim to provide just the key information needed for potential users. 
The site will feature different games, both a simple addition game and a slightly harder multiplication game.

### Colour and Typography
In regards to the design, I opted for a simple colour scheme. The main colours are a darker shade of blue, orange, grey and some black and white. Additionally on the hover effect there is a shade of orange for the navigation bar.
For the typography, I opted to use Noto Serif and Architects Daughter for the actual game.

### User Stories

#### User
- As a user I want to be able to navigate the page easily. 
- Additionally, I want to be able to easily play the game and know if my answer was correct. Whenever I get an answer incorrect, I want to know what the right answer was. 
- Lastly, I would like to be able to see the current leader board plus the social media pages for me to interact and follow.

#### Website owner
- As the website owner, I want to add a navigation form, so that users can click on each, and it will easily navigate them to that section of the page.
- By adding a check button, users can check if their answer was correct, this will make it better because they will know the answer before going on to the next maths question.
- As the website owner, I want our social media links to be clear at the bottom of the page, this will lead to more activity on our pages.
